function Wait-JobWithAnimation
{
<#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Waits for a background job to complete by showing a cursor and elapsed time.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Waits for a background job to complete by showing a cursor and elapsed time.

        The Git repo for this module can be found here: http://aka.ms/PowerShellForGitHub

    .PARAMETER Name
        The name of the job(s) that we are waiting to complete.

    .PARAMETER Description
        The text displayed next to the spinning cursor, explaining what the job is doing.

    .PARAMETER StopAllOnAnyFailure
        Will call Stop-Job on any jobs still Running if any of the specified jobs entered
        the Failed state.

    .EXAMPLE
        Wait-JobWithAnimation Job1
        Waits for a job named "Job1" to exit the "Running" state.  While waiting, shows
        a waiting cursor and the elapsed time.

        This is not a stand-in replacement for Wait-Job.  It does not provide the full
        set of configuration options that Wait-Job does.

function Write-Log
{
<#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Writes logging information to screen and log file simultaneously.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Writes logging information to screen and log file simultaneously.

        The Git repo for this module can be found here: http://aka.ms/PowerShellForGitHub

    .PARAMETER Message
        The message(s) to be logged. Each element of the array will be written to a separate line.

        This parameter supports pipelining but there are no
        performance benefits to doing so. For more information, see the .NOTES for this
        cmdlet.

    .PARAMETER Level
        The type of message to be logged.

    .PARAMETER Indent
        The number of spaces to indent the line in the log file.

    .PARAMETER Path
        The log file path.
        Defaults to $env:USERPROFILE\Documents\PowerShellForGitHub.log

    .PARAMETER Exception
        If present, the exception information will be logged after the messages provided.
        The actual string that is logged is obtained by passing this object to Out-String.

    .EXAMPLE
        Write-Log -Message "Everything worked." -Path C:\Debug.log

        Writes the message "Everything worked." to the screen as well as to a log file at "c:\Debug.log",
        with the caller's username and a date/time stamp prepended to the message.

    .EXAMPLE
        Write-Log -Message ("Everything worked.", "No cause for alarm.") -Path C:\Debug.log

        Writes the following message to the screen as well as to a log file at "c:\Debug.log",
        with the caller's username and a date/time stamp prepended to the message:

        Everything worked.
        No cause for alarm.

    .EXAMPLE
        Write-Log -Message "There may be a problem..." -Level Warning -Indent 2

        Writes the message "There may be a problem..." to the warning pipeline indented two spaces,
        as well as to the default log file with the caller's username and a date/time stamp
        prepended to the message.

    .EXAMPLE
        try { $null.Do() }
        catch { Write-Log -Message ("There was a problem.", "Here is the exception information:") -Exception $_ -Level Error }

        Logs the message:

        Write-Log : 2018-01-23 12:57:37 : dabelc : There was a problem.
        Here is the exception information:
        You cannot call a method on a null-valued expression.
        At line:1 char:7
        + try { $null.Do() } catch { Write-Log -Message ("There was a problem." ...
        +       ~~~~~~~~~~
            + CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: (:) [], RuntimeException
            + FullyQualifiedErrorId : InvokeMethodOnNull

    .INPUTS
        System.String

    .NOTES
        The "LogPath" configuration value indicates where the log file will be created.
        The "" determines if log entries will be made to the log file.
           If $false, log entries will ONLY go to the relevant output pipeline.

        Note that, although this function supports pipeline input to the -Message parameter,
        there is NO performance benefit to using the pipeline. This is because the pipeline
        input is simply accumulated and not acted upon until all input has been received.
        This behavior is intentional, in order for a statement like:
            "Multiple", "messages" | Write-Log -Exception $ex -Level Error
        to make sense.  In this case, the cmdlet should accumulate the messages and, at the end,
        include the exception information.

function DeepCopy-Object
<#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Creates a deep copy of a serializable object.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Creates a deep copy of a serializable object.
        By default, PowerShell performs shallow copies (simple references)
        when assigning objects from one variable to another.  This will
        create full exact copies of the provided object so that they
        can be manipulated independently of each other, provided that the
        object being copied is serializable.

        The Git repo for this module can be found here: http://aka.ms/PowerShellForGitHub

    .PARAMETER InputObject
        The object that is to be copied.  This must be serializable or this will fail.

    .EXAMPLE
        $bar = DeepCopy-Object -InputObject $foo
        Assuming that $foo is serializable, $bar will now be an exact copy of $foo, but
        any changes that you make to one will not affect the other.

    .RETURNS
        An exact copy of the PSObject that was just deep copied.

function Write-InteractiveHost
{
<#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Forwards to Write-Host only if the host is interactive, else does nothing.

    .DESCRIPTION
        A proxy function around Write-Host that detects if the host is interactive
        before calling Write-Host. Use this instead of Write-Host to avoid failures in
        non-interactive hosts.

        The Git repo for this module can be found here: http://aka.ms/PowerShellForGitHub

        Write-InteractiveHost "Test"

function Resolve-UnverifiedPath

    .SYNOPSIS
        A wrapper around Resolve-Path that works for paths that exist as well

        A wrapper around Resolve-Path that works for paths that exist as well

    .EXAMPLE
        Resolve-UnverifiedPath -Path 'c:\windows\notepad.exe'

        Returns the string 'c:\windows\notepad.exe'.

    .EXAMPLE
        Resolve-UnverifiedPath -Path '..\notepad.exe'

        Returns the string 'c:\windows\notepad.exe', assuming that it's executed from
        within 'c:\windows\system32' or some other sub-directory.

    .EXAMPLE
        Resolve-UnverifiedPath -Path '..\foo.exe'

        Returns the string 'c:\windows\foo.exe', assuming that it's executed from
        within 'c:\windows\system32' or some other sub-directory, even though this
        file doesn't exist.

    .DESCRIPTION
        A utility function for ensuring a given directory exists.

        If the directory does not already exist, it will be created.

    .PARAMETER Path
        A full or relative path to the directory that should exist when the function exits.

        Uses the Resolve-UnverifiedPath function to resolve relative paths.

function Get-HttpWebResponseContent

<#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Returns the content that may be contained within an HttpWebResponse object.

    .DESCRIPTION
        Returns the content that may be contained within an HttpWebResponse object.

        This would commonly be used when trying to get the potential content
        returned within a failing WebResponse.  Normally, when you call
        Invoke-WebRequest, it returns back a BasicHtmlWebResponseObject which
        directly contains a Content property, however if the web request fails,
        you get a WebException which contains a simpler WebResponse, which
        requires a bit more effort in order to access the raw response content.

    .PARAMETER WebResponse
        An HttpWebResponse object, typically the Response property on a WebException.

    .OUTPUTS
        System.String - The raw content that was included in a WebResponse; $null otherwise.
